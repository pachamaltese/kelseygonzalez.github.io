Kelsey E. Gonzalez is a PhD student in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. Her research focuses on computational methods, advanced statistical methods, and networks analysis in connection to thematic interests in the social determinants of physical and mental health and illness, racial and panethnic identities, and discrimination.

Kelsey has a strong methodological background following her extensive quantitative and computational methods training at the University of Arizona. She collaborates with Corey Abramson uncovering the economic, educational and health-related outcomes of bodyweight differences, with Daniel Martinez investigating racial and ethnic identities of Latinos in the United States, with Terrence Hill researching white fragility. She previously worked with Robin Stryker analyzing a nationally-representative survey on the perceptions of incivility and the media.

Kelsey received her MA in Sociology from the University of Arizona in 2018 where she investigated the impacts of personal networks and homophily on individuals’ perceptions of discrimination. Before coming to the University of Arizona, she earned her MPhil in Race, Ethnicity and Conflict from the Department of Sociology at Trinity College, Dublin in 2015.
